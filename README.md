# the-learner

Well good day to you, ladies and gentlemen, i am new to this whole programming scheme, i really do want to learn so i can do something with my life and i really need to get ahead, i am really desperate to get ahead, but other than that i have always been fascinated by computers and i really want to understand and know everything i possibly can about the subject, i want to dive in as much as i can and dive as deep as i can and absorb everything i want to really learn how a computer works! However i understand this can be challenging, and i am up for the challenge!
